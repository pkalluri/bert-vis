I am a PhD Student at Stanford University advised by Johan Ugander and a part-time Research Scientist at Facebook CDS. I am broadly interested in the theory and applications of Machine Learning in graphical settings. One of my main focuses has been designing and analyzing learning algorithms for discrete choice, where the aim is to understand preferences revealed from choices individuals make when presented with a set of alternatives. My work commonly falls at the intersection of Machine Learning, Statistics, Optimization, and Graph Theory.
